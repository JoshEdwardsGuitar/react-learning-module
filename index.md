# Introduction

## What is React?

> **React** (sometimes styled **React.js** or **ReactJS**) is an open-source JavaScript **library** providing a view for data rendered as HTML. 
> React views are typically rendered using components that contain additional components specified as custom HTML tags. 
> React promises programmers a model in which subcomponents cannot directly affect enclosing components ("data flows down"); 
> efficient updating of the HTML document when data changes; and a clean separation between components on a modern single-page application.
