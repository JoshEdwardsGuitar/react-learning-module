# Introduction

## What is React?

> **React** (sometimes styled **React.js** or **ReactJS**) is an open-source JavaScript **library** providing a view for data rendered as HTML. 
> React views are typically rendered using components that contain additional components specified as custom HTML tags. 
> React promises programmers a model in which subcomponents cannot directly affect enclosing components ("data flows down"); 
> efficient updating of the HTML document when data changes; and a clean separation between components on a modern single-page application.
> <br />--[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library))

## Motivation for this tutorial

This module aims to provide a solid knowledge base for everyone trying to learn React, 
by walking you, the curious developer, through the making of a small, simplified, yet non-trivial e-commerce application.

## Prerequisites

Although some of these tools/libraries are not mandatory for working with React, they have proven to be very useful and they help speeding up React development quite a lot.
Also, you'll probably need to know most of them when working with real React projects.

##### You **must** know the following, intermediate level at least:

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/CSS)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

##### You **should** know the following:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/doc)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)

##### Not really a necessity but very useful in conjunction with React

- [Immutable.JS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)

**Note: This guide assumes you know the React basics. Although most of the concepts will be briefly explained here,
 I recommend at least reading the official React documentation first.**
